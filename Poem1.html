 <h1>
    Whispers of goodbye
 </h1>
  <p><i>I feel the need to say it clear,</i></p>
<p><i>I love you still, though you’re not near.</i></p>
<p><i>You’re tired, I know, of hearing this,</i></p>
<p><i>But there are truths I cannot miss.</i></p>

<p><i>I saw you yesterday, you seemed so bright,</i></p>
<p><i>I doubt you miss me through the night.</i></p>
<p><i>Saying goodbye broke me in two;</i></p>
<p><i>I wonder if you know I still love you.</i></p>

<p><i>I thought you wouldn’t cause me pain,</i></p>
<p><i>That I’d be free from endless rain.</i></p>
<p><i>But now I’m gaining strength, you see,</i></p>
<p><i>And finally, I’m setting me free.</i></p>

<p><i>Don’t ask me why; the reasons are plain,</i></p>
<p><i>You know the truth beneath this strain.</i></p>

<p><i>Remember that day we broke apart?</i></p>
<p><i>Years have passed, yet I feel the dart—</i></p>
<p><i>Caught between love and the urge to flee,</i></p>
<p><i>You claimed I cheated, but it was thee.</i></p>

<p><i>You told our friends a twisted tale,</i></p>
<p><i>While I stood silent, my heart went pale.</i></p>
<p><i>I let you go and buried my strife,</i></p>
<p><i>While you chose her to share your life.</i></p>

<p><i>You said, “Don’t cry,” but how could I?</i></p>
<p><i>You hurt me deeply, and I don’t lie.</i></p>
<p><i>Years have flown, and I’m still sore;</i></p>
<p><i>I know how to swim, yet I’m drowning more.</i></p>

<p><i>If this is truly our last goodbye,</i></p>
<p><i>Then leave me now, please don’t ask why.</i></p>
<p><i>If this is the end, then farewell, my dear;</i></p>
<p><i>I’ll face the truth without the fear.</i></p>

<p><i>I won’t hide what I feel inside,</i></p>
<p><i>I still love you, but I must abide.</i></p>
<p><i>Myself needs me, it’s time to rise,</i></p>
<p><i>For I lost myself in your disguise.</i></p>

<p><i>Don’t fret, my love; these feelings will wane,</i></p>
<p><i>One day I’ll find peace amidst the pain.</i></p>

 <h2>When love fades.
   
 </h2>
<p>
  <i>Join me as we revisit the past,</i><br>
    <i>We’ll hurry through memories, but they’ll forever last.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Let’s remember the love that we once shared,</i><br>
    <i>How we became one, how deeply we cared.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>But the winds of change began to blow,</i><br>
    <i>The joy in our hearts began to slow.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Months turned to days of hardship and strife,</i><br>
    <i>Your sweet “yes” felt like the promise of life.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Smiles and laughter filled the air,</i><br>
    <i>You said, “I love you,” and I was lost in your stare.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Yet, as a year slipped quietly away,</i><br>
    <i>The warmth of our love began to decay.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Excuses piled up, busy with life,</i><br>
    <i>In our embrace, there was space for strife.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>But then I saw you in a joyful scene,</i><br>
    <i>With someone new, laughing like a dream.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>I tried to ignore it, hoping for a sign,</i><br>
    <i>But I was mistaken; my heart was blind.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>One evening, a message rang clear,</i><br>
    <i>“Let’s meet,” you said, filling me with cheer.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>But just moments in, you took my breath away,</i><br>
    <i>“Now I have someone else,” was all you could say.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Your words cut deep, left me reeling,</i><br>
    <i>Lost in confusion, my heart no longer feeling.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>You said you didn’t want to hurt me,</i><br>
    <i>But the pain you caused ignited my worry.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>I’m human, after all...</i><br>
    <i>Don’t toy with me; I’m ready to fall.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>I was a fool, yes, blinded by love,</i><br>
    <i>Yet you left me alone, like a cold winter dove.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>I thought my love would be enough,</i><br>
    <i>But for someone else, you sought freedom’s bluff.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Now I’m left grieving, not knowing how to cope,</i><br>
    <i>Wondering how to rebuild my lost hope.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>I hope you realize,</i><br>
    <i>I still love you, but it’s time to say goodbye.</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Though wounds remain, they’re starting to mend,</i><br>
    <i>In our story, memories will linger, but now I must end.</i>
</p>

 <h3>Echoes to the moon.
   
 </h3>
  <p><i>You and I, beneath the moon's soft glow,</i></p>
<p><i>Just the two of us, where secrets flow.</i></p>
<p><i>Promises made in the night’s sweet hush,</i></p>
<p><i>But you've hurt me, left me in a rush.</i></p>

<p><i>You said, “It’s only YOU, no one else,”</i></p>
<p><i>But I know the truth you’ve chosen to sell.</i></p>
<p><i>Caught you in shadows, where you don’t belong,</i></p>
<p><i>With another girl, it feels all wrong.</i></p>

<p><i>You brushed me aside, claimed it was naught,</i></p>
<p><i>But to me, the pain is a heavy thought.</i></p>
<p><i>The day I awaited has finally come,</i></p>
<p><i>Here’s our ending, the silence is numb.</i></p>

<p><i>You said I’d find love, just wait a while,</i></p>
<p><i>But a year has passed, lost in denial.</i></p>
<p><i>You once whispered, “Remind me of how we thrived,”</i></p>
<p><i>But now I know that our love has died.</i></p>

<p><i>I’m ready to go, no more tears to spill,</i></p>
<p><i>I won’t ask for answers, no more heart to fill.</i></p>
<p><i>Goodbye, my love, as I gaze at the moon,</i></p>
<p><i>I accept our story has ended too soon.</i></p>
  
 <h4>Love turns cold.
   
 </h4>
  <p><i>Let me share a tale of heartache and strife,</i></p>
<p><i>About the first man who shattered my life.</i></p>
<p><i>He was my best buddy, a bond I held dear,</i></p>
<p><i>But he walked away, leaving my heart full of fear.</i></p>

<p><i>I remember begging, my heart full of pain,</i></p>
<p><i>Watching him leave as I called out in vain.</i></p>
<p><i>“Please stay,” I whispered, my voice full of dread,</i></p>
<p><i>“Forget me,” he replied, his words cold as lead.</i></p>

<p><i>“Treat me like a ghost, let me vanish from sight,</i></p>
<p><i>There’s nothing between us; it’s over tonight.”</i></p>
<p><i>I stood on the balcony, hoping he'd change,</i></p>
<p><i>Waiting for signs that his heart might rearrange.</i></p>

<p><i>Seconds turned to minutes, then hours slipped by,</i></p>
<p><i>I ventured inside, still hoping for a lie.</i></p>
<p><i>But reality struck, and my heart sank like lead,</i></p>
<p><i>Moments of joy replaced with tears instead.</i></p>

<p><i>I thought of our laughter, the love that we shared,</i></p>
<p><i>Now echoing silence showed how much you cared.</i></p>
<p><i>I let my tears fall, the weight felt so strong,</i></p>
<p><i>In a home turned to shadows, where we both belonged.</i></p>

<p><i>And in that still moment, a truth became clear,</i></p>
<p><i>Not every ending brings joy or good cheer.</i></p>
<p><i>Not every love story finds peace or delight,</i></p>
<p><i>Sometimes we find sorrow in the cold of the night.</i></p>
  
 <h5>The distance between us.
 </h5>
  <p><i>We are familiar strangers, paths crossed once before,</i></p>
<p><i>In the hallway I wandered, you were with someone more.</i></p>
<p><i>A chance encounter happened, you said, “I’m sorry,”</i></p>
<p><i>But in that brief exchange, we lost all our glory.</i></p>

<p><i>Someone asked about us, they wondered if we fought,</i></p>
<p><i>I spoke of our ending; it hurt more than I thought.</i></p>
<p><i>She looked at me in shock, “Just yesterday, you two—”</i></p>
<p><i>“Yeah, that was our last day, now we’re through and through.”</i></p>

<p><i>Once we shared our laughter, yesterday felt so bright,</i></p>
<p><i>Now we drift like shadows, fading out of sight.</i></p>
<p><i>A familiar stranger, once my heart's desire,</i></p>
<p><i>What they thought would be forever has turned to cold fire.</i></p>

<p><i>They believed in our promise, that love would endure,</i></p>
<p><i>But sadly, we can’t be together, our hearts can’t be sure.</i></p>
  
  
 <h6>Masked truths. 
 </h6>
  

<p><i>Behind every laugh,</i></p>
<p><i>What do you really feel?</i></p>
<p><i>Each smile you carve,</i></p>
<p><i>What struggles do you conceal?</i></p>

<p><i>With every "I'm okay," how are you really?</i></p>
<p><i>With every "It's fine," is that the truth, sincerely?</i></p>

<p><i>In front of the crowd, though you're in pain,</i></p>
<p><i>You hide your feelings, playing this game.</i></p>
<p><i>Is it so hard to let go of what’s real?</i></p>
<p><i>Or do you fear judgment—</i></p>
<p><i>Is that the deal?</i></p>

<p><i>You pretend to be bright,</i></p>
<p><i>But alone in your room,</i></p>
<p><i>You cry through the night,</i></p>
<p><i>Lost in your gloom.</i></p>

<p><i>Sometimes it’s nice to have someone to hear,</i></p>
<p><i>But they don’t truly care; it’s painfully clear.</i></p>
<p><i>Hoping tomorrow brings peace and delight,</i></p>
<p><i>That you'll wake up to joy, and everything feels right.</i></p>

<p><i>What’s the story behind your "I’m okay" reply?</i></p>
<p><i>Are you truly just fine, or a mask you comply,</i></p>
<p><i>Hiding your feelings, not wanting to show,</i></p>
<p><i>The realness inside that aches to grow?</i></p>
  
  <h7>Lily's Lament.</h7>
<p><i>Her angelic face, a lovely sight,</i></p>
<p><i>With laughter that dances, pure and bright.</i></p>
<p><i>Lily shares her smile with everyone near,</i></p>
<p><i>A gentle heart, always spreading cheer.</i></p>

<p><i>In her joy, she's a beauty so rare,</i></p>
<p><i>Unlike the rest, none can compare.</i></p>
<p><i>Boys gaze in wonder, longing to know,</i></p>
<p><i>What it feels like to be loved by her glow.</i></p>

<p><i>A princess without a crown, she fell for a man,</i></p>
<p><i>Not one to bring flowers, but he had a plan.</i></p>
<p><i>He wrote her sweet letters, with words that inspire,</i></p>
<p><i>She fell for a poet, igniting her fire.</i></p>

<p><i>Her heart poured out in verses so deep,</i></p>
<p><i>In her love for him, she dared to leap.</i></p>
<p><i>But his tales, once tender, began to deceive,</i></p>
<p><i>The truth in his poems made it hard to believe.</i></p>

<p><i>As the light grew dim, the shadows unveiled,</i></p>
<p><i>The lies wrapped in sonnets left her heart pale.</i></p>
<p><i>A writer’s sweet words had broken her trust,</i></p>
<p><i>Now Lily’s heart lay in ashes and dust.</i></p>

<p><i>Oh, what can I do for my dear friend,</i></p>
<p><i>Who once shone so brightly, now struggles to mend?</i></p>
<p><i>She hides in the silence, in shadows she weeps,</i></p>
<p><i>Afraid to love again, her heart still keeps.</i></p>

<p><i>The laughter has faded, the joy lost in time,</i></p>
<p><i>I see her tears fall, like a soft, silent chime.</i></p>
<p><i>"Why not move on?" I gently implore,</i></p>
<p><i>“Why seek another when pain’s at the core?”</i></p>

<p><i>"Why find another to shatter my heart?</i></p>
<p><i>To feel so useless, once again torn apart?"</i></p>
<p><i>Her cold, bitter words echo in my mind,</i></p>
<p><i>A once-charming lady, now feeling confined.</i></p>

<p><i>So unlucky to love one who took her for granted,</i></p>
<p><i>In a tragedy’s grip, her spirit left stranded.</i></p>
<p><i>She misses the girl with the radiant smile,</i></p>
<p><i>Longing for peace, even just for a while.</i></p>
  
  <h8> Heart's dilemma</h8>
<p><i>I was once a Juliet, and you were my Romeo,</i></p>
<p><i>This time, no Capulet ball to steal the show.</i></p>
<p><i>It was a Promenade where I twirled with delight,</i></p>
<p><i>Wearing a necklace of jade, my heart felt so light.</i></p>

<p><i>I remember you standing, just waiting to take,</i></p>
<p><i>My hand, without asking, a leap of faith's sake.</i></p>
<p><i>But I guess you grew weary of waiting your turn,</i></p>
<p><i>So you asked my partner for a moment to yearn.</i></p>

<p><i>Next thing I knew, we were dancing so free,</i></p>
<p><i>You introduced yourself, "I'm Romeo," said he.</i></p>
<p><i>I laughed at the jest, replying with glee,</i></p>
<p><i>“Then I must be Juliet; how perfect are we?”</i></p>

<p><i>We shared in a moment that felt like a dream,</i></p>
<p><i>As if we’d met before, caught in love’s beam.</i></p>
<p><i>When next we encountered, you called me your dear,</i></p>
<p><i>“I missed you,” you said, and I smiled at your cheer.</i></p>

<p><i>How funny it seemed, though we’d met just last week,</i></p>
<p><i>Our hearts spoke a language that neither could speak.</i></p>
<p><i>My family protested, but we were quite bold,</i></p>
<p><i>Defying their wishes, our love uncontrolled.</i></p>

<p><i>This time, not like the story of old,</i></p>
<p><i>No marriage in haste, no fate to behold.</i></p>
<p><i>You weren’t the Romeo who took lives with his sword,</i></p>
<p><i>But you did fight for us, your passion restored.</i></p>

<p><i>They caught us embracing, and pulled us apart,</i></p>
<p><i>I sat in my room, feeling lost in my heart.</i></p>
<p><i>When my mother called me, it wasn’t Paris she sought,</i></p>
<p><i>But someone else for me, a plan that she wrought.</i></p>

<p><i>“I’ll think on your words; just give me some space,”</i></p>
<p><i>My cousin chimed in, “He’s a good guy, embrace!”</i></p>
<p><i>But I knew in my heart that it was you I adored,</i></p>
<p><i>No one could take your place, my feelings explored.</i></p>

<p><i>This time I’m not Juliet, the one with a scheme,</i></p>
<p><i>Not the girl who pretended, lost deep in a dream.</i></p>
<p><i>And you’re not the Romeo who rushed to my side,</i></p>
<p><i>Believing I’d died, in love's bitter tide.</i></p>

<p><i>It’s not us anymore; we’ve drifted apart,</i></p>
<p><i>Not two star-crossed lovers with fate at the heart.</i></p>
<p><i>We didn’t die young in the name of our love,</i></p>
<p><i>But our relationship shattered, like wings of a dove.</i></p>

<p><i>Juliet and Romeo fell to love’s cruel sting,</i></p>
<p><i>While we parted in sorrow, a different kind of sting.</i></p>
<p><i>We believed in the dove’s wish to return to its home,</i></p>
<p><i>So you set me free, and in silence, I roam.</i></p>

<p><i>That’s the end of our tale, where your heart found another,</i></p>
<p><i>You didn’t come back to me, and I lost my sweet lover.</i></p>
<p><i>This, the tragic story of you and of me,</i></p>
<p><i>Two souls who once danced, now lost in the sea.</i></p>

  <h9> Heart's Diverge.
  </h9>
 <p><i>She found you while I was searching for him,</i></p>
<p><i>She chose you when my chances felt dim.</i></p>
<p><i>You took her hand when I had given my all,</i></p>
<p><i>You chose him, and now I feel so small.</i></p>

<p><i>I love him more than he’ll ever know,</i></p>
<p><i>I fought for his heart, putting on quite a show.</i></p>
<p><i>I saw him smile, his eyes shining bright,</i></p>
<p><i>While he gazed at you, lost in your light.</i></p>

<p><i>We used to embrace, wrapped up in our charms,</i></p>
<p><i>Goodbyes were sweet with kisses, safe in our arms.</i></p>
<p><i>He’d carry my bag, always eager to please,</i></p>
<p><i>Staying up late just to bring me some ease.</i></p>

<p><i>USED TO… and now he’s not mine anymore,</i></p>
<p><i>He’s yours to hold, while I’m left on the floor.</i></p>
<p><i>So please, don’t let him feel the hurt that I’ve felt,</i></p>
<p><i>Don’t let him struggle with love’s heavy belt.</i></p>

<p><i>Love him deeper than I ever could do,</i></p>
<p><i>He chose you over me, and that’s sadly true.</i></p>
<p><i>Take care of his heart, though it breaks me inside,</i></p>
<p><i>I’ll find my own peace as I watch from the side.</i></p>

  <h10>Misplaced love.</h10>
<p><i>No one ever told me that love could bring such pain,</i></p>
<p><i>I’ve met so many people, yet none felt the same.</i></p>
<p><i>I’ve taken all the compliments, still lost in the fray,</i></p>
<p><i>So clueless and confused, I’m just drifting away.</i></p>

<p><i>The breakup left me aching, with questions unfulfilled,</i></p>
<p><i>Blame weighs heavy on me; it’s my heart that’s been killed.</i></p>
<p><i>Longing for the lover who never treated me right,</i></p>
<p><i>Chasing shadows of memories that haunt me each night.</i></p>

<p><i>How can I love someone who’s not part of my joy,</i></p>
<p><i>Yet my heart still beats strong for that careless boy?</i></p>
<p><i>He held my hand when others were in sight,</i></p>
<p><i>But turned cold and distant when there was no light.</i></p>

<p><i>As if I were hidden, a secret to bear,</i></p>
<p><i>But I’m not a mistake; I’m a heart laid bare.</i></p>
<p><i>He treated others kindly, while I waited alone,</i></p>
<p><i>Missed all the big moments, like I was a stone.</i></p>

<p><i>I waited for replies, only to hear he’s busy,</i></p>
<p><i>Then saw his latest post, it left me feeling dizzy.</i></p>
<p><i>Shattered but loving, I still felt the ache,</i></p>
<p><i>Desperate for answers, I just needed a break.</i></p>

<p><i>I asked about her, begged for the truth,</i></p>
<p><i>But you lied to my face, stripped away my youth.</i></p>
<p><i>I sought your honesty, I’d have taken you back,</i></p>
<p><i>But that final betrayal put my heart on the rack.</i></p>

<p><i>I hoped in the early days you’d come clean at last,</i></p>
<p><i>Reveal all the secrets, let go of the past.</i></p>
<p><i>But now I stand guarded, afraid to let in,</i></p>
<p><i>For the wounds run deep from the love that’s been thin.</i></p>
