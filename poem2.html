    The cries.
  </h1>
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I'm drowning in my thoughts as I looked around me, I see how the hair of my parents was slowly turning gray. Their body was becoming thinner, my dad looked skinny as I can see how his leg showed the traces of his bone.</i></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>My parents are growing old, yet we're not settled. There are dreams we still need to achieve, we haven't reached any goals. We're not satisfied and established. Our family's not in a great relationship. We often talk, we're broken living in this broken home. We have a lot of arguments.</i></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Do you know what's making me sad? It's the idea that we know the problem but it is not something we can fix. I feel like we'll going to leave this world with this feeling.</i></p>
</div>

  <h2>______</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I spent my time watching movies. I just wanted to cry and I did. This time, it wasn't for you. I cried for myself. For all the realization... it's too much to carry.</i></p>
</div>

  <h3>______</h3>
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>It happened. The memories and the scars are still fresh. It was never blurry. I can clearly remember everything.</i></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>How can I forget something that haunts me every time? How can I forget the trauma I'm still trying to overcome?</i></p>
</div>

  <h4>______</h4>
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>When the warmth between us suddenly faded, and the space between us felt like an ever-widening gap, I started searching for every possible reason. You stopped talking to me; even a simple "Hi" felt like too much to ask. I tried to understand and respect your busy days, the space we each needed, but still, I couldn’t help but wonder—what went wrong?</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Days would pass before you'd reply, and when you did, it was never the response I longed for. How much meaning could I really find in a single smiley face?</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I began overthinking, looking for hidden meanings. Was there something more behind that small symbol? Or was there a bigger truth I was refusing to see?</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Then I found her. The first time I saw her, everything became clear. I understood, then, why you chose to be with her instead of making time for me. Your smiles, your laughter—they were all for her.</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>In that moment, I didn’t need any other sign. It was a message, plain and clear.</i></p>
</div>
  <h5>______</h5>
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve cried since the day we last saw each other. All I know is, I never seem to smile when your name comes to mind. Memories of us hit like waves, shaking my resolve and leaving me feeling unsteady. The impact is always the same—the same ache, the same heavy pull. When you left, the pain stayed, and it haunts me still.</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>My heart aches each time I think of the "us" I used to know. The hurt hasn’t faded. It’s still there, raw and relentless. The wounds haven’t healed.</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>You found me whole and happy, and you left me broken and haunted.</i></p>
</div>
  <h6>______</h6>
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I always pray that your apologies were not because we met, or maybe because I loved you. I hope you're not sorry for having me.</i></p>
</div>
  <h7>______</h7>
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>And if ever there is someone I will openly embrace to love me and someone I will love wholeheartedly, I pray to God that if my next relationship is part of the trial and will later fail, I hope he'll meet my parents. Accept them, love them, respect them. I hope they get along well. I hope he can make them feel that with him I am safe, there's nothing to worry about. Because we do not know when we will stay alive. I'd like to at least make my parents feel assured that there's someone who will take care of me, and love me.</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I won't be asking for everlasting love; it will be a bonus if possible. But in the meantime, I'd like to assure my parents, to take their worries away. Because they deserve it.</i></p>
</div>

  <h8>______</h8>
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>We found ourselves shouting through the pen,</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Witnessed the power held by letters,</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Felt the depth unearthed by rhyme.</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>And after crafting hundreds of verses,</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Only then did we truly learn what it meant to be free,</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Having chronicled the grief of memory.</i></p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>For at last, the ink was overflowing,</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>The words had gained more power,</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>The rhymes had dug deep,</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>The poems had traveled far enough for us to find joy again.</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>The pen had become strong enough to wield as a weapon,</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>And at last, we no longer wished to return to the ways we had once been shattered.</i></p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Now, we can draw our own pain,</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>We are the ones tending to our own wounds and rage.</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>We are the writers of our sorrows,</i></p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>And we are the ones who will embrace and rebuild ourselves.</i></p>
</div>

  <h9>______</h9>
  <p><i>The world is vast and wide.</i></p>

<p><i>As I laugh, the world laughs along with me;</i></p>
<p><i>But when it’s time for tears, I weep alone.</i></p>
<p><i>A beautiful mountain may cradle its viewers,</i></p>
<p><i>Yet beneath its grandeur, it carries burdens of its own.</i></p>

<p><i>As I sing, the birds harmonize with my voice;</i></p>
<p><i>But sighs dissolve into the air,</i></p>
<p><i>And joyful screams can mask a breaking soul</i></p>
<p><i>Caught beneath the weight of hidden despair.</i></p>

<p><i>They seek your laughter, revel in your light,</i></p>
<p><i>But when sorrow strikes, they quickly turn away.</i></p>
<p><i>They crave the joy you bring,</i></p>
<p><i>Yet shy away from the shadows of your pain.</i></p>

<p><i>With every embrace, they tighten the chains,</i></p>
<p><i>Binding your hands and feet,</i></p>
<p><i>Leaving you trapped in a cycle of misery,</i></p>
<p><i>Pierced by the words of those you once valued.</i></p>

<p><i>The haunting whispers echo in your mind;</i></p>
<p><i>A scream for help, a voice yearning,</i></p>
<p><i>A cry steeped in agony,</i></p>
<p><i>Longing for relief that never comes.</i></p>

<p><i>Rejoice, for you have many friends,</i></p>
<p><i>Yet grieve, for their loyalty is fleeting.</i></p>
<p><i>You will lose them in time,</i></p>
<p><i>Left alone to face life’s harsh animosity.</i></p>

<p><i>They build walls that keep you at bay,</i></p>
<p><i>Denying you closeness, warmth, and care.</i></p>
<p><i>When you lower your defenses for them,</i></p>
<p><i>You find yourself abandoned by those you love.</i></p>

<p><i>You are the word that lingers on the tongue,</i></p>
<p><i>Elusive and hard to remember.</i></p>
<p><i>You are the unwritten story no one wants to hear,</i></p>
<p><i>The picture in a dusty frame that no one seems to notice.</i></p>

<p><i>I sometimes wish to be a flower,</i></p>
<p><i>Yet I wonder how long I’ll keep sending myself one.</i></p>
<p><i>Atop the mountain built from my tears,</i></p>
<p><i>Not a day passes without offering myself a bloom.</i></p>

<p><i>Here I am, buried beneath my sorrow,</i></p>
<p><i>Caged by sadness, longing for those who should care,</i></p>
<p><i>For the love they took for granted now feels like a death.</i></p>
<p><i>And still, I remain beyond parable,</i></p>
<p><i>Swaying alone with every rhyme,</i></p>
<p><i>Heartbeats echoing through each line,</i></p>
<p><i>Dancing with the letters that define me.</i></p>

<p><i>I am the mystery within the masterpiece,</i></p>
<p><i>Only noticed by a few,</i></p>
<p><i>Where peace eludes every word,</i></p>
<p><i>And fear and misery reside.</i></p>

<p><i>Flowery words feel like swords thrust into my chest,</i></p>
<p><i>Sapping my breath,</i></p>
<p><i>Silencing my voice,</i></p>
<p><i>Leaving me with a bitter taste of betrayal.</i></p>

<p><i>In this battle with depression,</i></p>
<p><i>I wonder if anyone else fights the same struggle,</i></p>
<p><i>Shed a mountain of tears,</i></p>
<p><i>And becomes engulfed by the darkness within.</i></p>

<p><i>Is there someone out there who shares this experience?</i></p>
<p><i>Where darkness is home,</i></p>
<p><i>And dark days are all too common?</i></p>
<p><i>If so, tell me how to conquer the monster inside,</i></p>
<p><i>How to vanquish this beast without sacrificing myself.</i></p>
<p><i>How to win a battle with depression when depression feels like me?</i></p>

  <h10>______</h10>
  <p><i>When I said you are free now,</i></p>
<p><i>what I truly meant was:</i></p>
<p><i>Love her now,</i></p>
<p><i>and I am ready to let go,</i></p>
<p><i>if your happiness comes at the cost of my pain.</i></p>
<p><i>Your heart will heal, and like you,</i></p>
<p><i>you’ll discover joy anew,</i></p>
<p><i>and we will both find happiness in the embrace of others.</i></p>
<p><i>When I urged you to be happy,</i></p>
<p><i>I wished for you to escape the bitterness</i></p>
<p><i>that comes from a heart still hoping.</i></p>
<p><i>Promises fulfilled with someone new,</i></p>
<p><i>dreams pursued in solitude.</i></p>
<p><i>And when I whispered, “I loved you,”</i></p>
<p><i>what I meant was you are free now.</i></p>
<p><i>For all I ever desired was for you to find joy,</i></p>
<p><i>even if it means being with someone else.</i></p>
<p><i>And when I say, “I’m okay now,”</i></p>
<p><i>what I truly mean is you can no longer hurt me.</i></p>
<p><i>My tears have dried,</i></p>
<p><i>and I will no longer question my worth.</i></p>
<p><i>For if I truly love you,</i></p>
<p><i>there will come a time when I, too, will be free.</i></p>
<p><i>Once I loved you,</i></p>
<p><i>but now, it is myself that I cherish.</i></p>
  <h11>________</h11>
  <p><i>Bagamat matagal na rin nang matamis na oo ko'y naringgan,</i></p>
<p><i>lumipas na rin ang maalab na pag-iibigan,</i></p>
<p><i>Maging ang mga pangako'y na iwanan,</i></p>
<p><i>Dapit hapon, magkadaupang palad at nakatanaw sa kalangitan.</i></p>

<p><i>Hindi tayo magkamayaw sa pagkamit ng pangarap,</i></p>
<p><i>Noon ay sumusayaw pa tayo sa mga ulap,</i></p>
<p><i>Abo't langit ang ngiting nangakong magsasama sa hinaharap,</i></p>
<p><i>Kasabay ng pagdama sa init ng mga yakap.</i></p>

<p><i>"Kailan ka babalik?</i></p>
<p><i>Muli kayang mararampian ng iyong halik?</i></p>
<p><i>Sa 'yong yakap ay nananabik,</i></p>
<p><i>Paumanhin sapagkat ang aking isip ay 'di matahimik.</i></p>

<p><i>Na alala mo pa ba ang minsang tayo?</i></p>
<p><i>Ako ang siyang pinapangarap mo,</i></p>
<p><i>Magsusumpaan sa altar na magsasama hanggang dulo,</i></p>
<p><i>Ako... ako ang siyang pag-ibig mo."</i></p>

<p><i>   Ako pa rin dapat 'yon.</i></p>

<p><i>Masyado rin akong na bulag sa pag-ibig,</i></p>
<p><i>Nagawa kong lumuhod at yakapin ang relasyong nanlalamig,</i></p>
<p><i>Ang pang-unawa'y pilit kong pinalawig,</i></p>
<p><i>Ang pagsusumamo'y hindi mo kailan man dirinig.</i></p>

<p><i>Sa pagsarado ng daan patungo sa 'yo,</i></p>
<p><i>Nahinuha kong mali ang pagsuyo,</i></p>
<p><i>Hindi ko dapat pinaalala at ipinagmakaawang mahalin mo muli ako,</i></p>
<p><i>Sapagkat ang tunay na pag-ibig ay hindi makalilimot at lalayo.</i></p>

  <h12>________</h12>
  <p><i>For a love not destined to be, but met halfway. This is for you.</i></p>

<p><i>On the street called 143, our paths crossed unexpectedly.</i></p>
<p><i>I was frustrated to find my belongings strewn across the pavement.</i></p>
<p><i>You simply brushed past me, ignoring my distress.</i></p>
<p><i>I couldn’t let that slide, so in a moment of anger, I picked up my book and hurled it at you—headshot!</i></p>

<p><i>Your eyes blazed with fury, disbelief etched on your face.</i></p>
<p><i>As you approached me, my knees trembled under the weight of your impending confrontation.</i></p>
<p><i>You shouted, demanding to know why I had done such a thing.</i></p>
<p><i>With a shaky voice, I tried to explain, but all you did was laugh and walk away, dismissing my words like they meant nothing.</i></p>

<p><i>From that day on, I lost count of how many times I cursed you under my breath.</i></p>
<p><i>It’s funny how fate has a way of weaving its threads.</i></p>
<p><i>The very next day, at my favorite coffee shop, there you were, flirting with another girl.</i></p>
<p><i>When our eyes met, you simply smirked and summoned the waiter.</i></p>
<p><i>A few moments later, I was taken aback when the waiter brought me a cup of coffee with a note on a sticky note attached.</i></p>

<p><i>“For a grumpy lady.”</i></p>

<p><i>Despite my annoyance, I found myself intrigued.</i></p>
<p><i>How could you order coffee for someone else while with your girl?</i></p>
<p><i>Summoning all my courage, I walked over to your table and handed you the cup.</i></p>
<p><i>My cheeks flushed when you introduced me as your girl to the lady beside you—your cousin.</i></p>

<p><i>Days turned into a blur as you continued to invade my thoughts, my heart, and even my personal space.</i></p>
<p><i>You became my persistent annoyance, the most infuriating person I had never imagined I’d develop feelings for.</i></p>

<p><i>From the countless stories I’ve read, our kind of tale could easily make readers swoon, with hearts intertwined and sweet exchanges of “I love you” and “I miss you.”</i></p>

<p><i>But ours was different.</i></p>
<p><i>Those stories concluded with joyous endings, where the characters lived happily ever after.</i></p>
<p><i>As for us? We drifted apart, walking in opposite directions, leaving a trail of hurt and a heartbreaking farewell.</i></p>
<p><i>We fell. We broke.</i></p>

<p><i>And that is how it ended.</i></p>
  
  <h13>_______</h13>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <p><i>And I guess we build a lot of memories and meant to drift apart in the end.</i></p>

    <p><i>I'm sure cutting me off from your life wasn't easy, because I feel the same.</i></p>
    <p><i>Whenever I saw a glimpse of your day, it makes me talk to myself and say</i></p>
    <p><i>"The photos would look so much better if I was there" because I miss how we were</i></p>
    <p><i>able to hang out and smile at each other without hesitation, without gaps and barriers</i></p>
    <p><i>in between.</i></p>

    <p><i>It may be hard and sad as we go through this process of healing and moving on</i></p>
    <p><i>to different paths, but one thing is for sure... the day will come for us to cross</i></p>
    <p><i>the path and meet halfway, and when it comes there won't be dead air,</i></p>
    <p><i>there won't be hesitation to say hi, and we won't feel awkward to look at each other.</i></p>

    <p><i>We will talk casually, reminisce about the good old times, and continue walking</i></p>
    <p><i>on our chosen careers. We're good. We will be able to do that someday.</i></p>
    <p><i>With different people by our side and our new set of circles of friends,</i></p>
    <p><i>we will not label ourselves as a stranger.</i></p>

    <p><i>No, we're not strangers. We're not going back to strangers.</i></p>
    <p><i>We were friends. We were best friends.</i></p>
    <p><i>We're familiar with each other.</i></p>

    <p><i>And I hope you don't see me as a stranger, because it will only make me feel</i></p>
    <p><i>like you regret what we had shared.</i></p>

    <p><i>There are always "Strangers, friends, close friends, (lovers), and back to being strangers"</i></p>
    <p><i>cycle.</i></p>

    <p><i>I don't like it to be that way, I want to be remembered even if it's my flaws</i></p>
    <p><i>or my wrongs, but I want to remain as someone who was once part of their lives.</i></p>

    <p><i>I don't want to go back to that stranger.</i></p>

    <p><i>I want to be remembered.</i></p>
